        Poison centers have been established worldwide in order to address the
        problem of poisoning. Time is a critical factor in the management of
        poisoning such that 24/7 hotlines were established in these poison
        centers that operate to provide guidance and information on poisons
        and poisoning management and epidemiologic surveillance to various
        stakeholders including regulatory agencies, health institutions,
        medical personal including physicians, nurses and first responders and
        even the general public. In the Philippines, this has started in 1975
        with the creation of a poison center at the University of the
        Philippines â€“ Philippine General Hospital. Throughout the years,
        various poison centers have been established by the Philippine
        Department of Health throughout the country, having recognized the
        need for the creation of these specialized centers that are equipped
        with the necessary information for poisoning management and
        surveillance.
